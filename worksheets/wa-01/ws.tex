This assignment is due Wednesday 1/31 before lab. Please turn in neat, and organized, answers hand-written on standard-sized paper without any fringe. Problem set 1 is all about strings and arrays, these are fundamental data types, they are incredibly important to understand if you wish to be sucessful in this class! 

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

% 1
\item Write a function that returns the length of a given string. EX: Given \verb|"Test"|, return \verb|4|.

% GeeksForGeeks
\item Using the function you defined above, create another function that returns true if a given string is a palindrome, and false if it is not. EX: "ABCBA" is a palindrome, "ABC" is not.

% GeeksForGeeks
\item Define a function that returns the most frequently occuring character inside of a string. What would you have to change in order for this program to return the least frequently occuring character? 

% GeeksForGeeks
\item Write a \textit{program} that prints the number of words in a given string. For this exercise please define the string you'll be using within your program, do not use \verb|std::cin|.

% CodeForWin
\item Define a function to \textit{toggle} the case of a given string. (Running this twice on a given string should yield the starting string)

% CodeForWin
\item Write a program that can find a missing number in an array of integers ranging from 1 to $n$. EX: Given \verb|[1, 2, 3, 5]|, ouput \verb|4|. 

% CodeForWin
\item Define a function that prints the minimum and maximum elements in an unsorted array of integers. How would this code change if the array were sorted?

% CodeForWin
\item Write a program that removes any duplicate integers from an array. EX: Given \verb|[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]|, the program should print \verb|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]|.

% CodeForWin
\item How would you implement a function that reverses a given array in place? Write a high-level psuedo-code for this function.

%
\item Briefly describe the difference between an array of integers and characters. How would you find their length? Space Requirements?

%
\item Using psuedo code, write a function that converts a string of numbers to their decimal equivalent. EX: Given \verb|"1 2 3 4 5"|, generate the array \verb|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]|.
