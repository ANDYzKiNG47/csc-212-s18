# Lab 06: Lab + Recursion(3) = Lab + (Lab + Recursion(2))

Today you will be implementing a few recursive algorithms. The neat thing about recursion is that you can solve problems with a relatively small amount of well thought out code. 

The google form for submitting can be found at [here.](https://goo.gl/forms/8ouzJARdNmOrgV1K3) The instructors will open the form at the start of the lab session.
