# Lab 06: Lab + Recursion(3) = Lab + (Lab + Recursion(2))

Today you will be implementing a few recursive algorithms. The neat thing about recursion is that you can solve problems with a relatively small amount of well thought out code.

The google form for submitting can be found at [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd43A_6lWQOpTA5uFMDK90GErP6kyfgBkeUvFJ87HI-CT02RA/viewform?usp=sf_link) The instructors will open the form near the end of the lab session.
